# README: Simulating a Two‐Host QEMU/KVM Cluster on One Laptop

This guide walks you through all the commands and steps to mimic two separate hypervisor hosts (Host-VM-1 and Host-VM-2), each running their own nested guest (Nested-VM-A and Nested-VM-B), all on a single Ubuntu laptop.

## 1. On Your Ubuntu Laptop (Physical Host)

### 1.1 Install KVM/QEMU, libvirt, virt-manager, etc.
